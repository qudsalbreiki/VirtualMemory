Pediatric Surgery Management System
Overview
Virtual memory is a memory management technique used in operating systems to manage storage space, maintaining speed and efficiency during execution. This report explores the virtual memory technique, covering its concept, evolution, advantages, and future design plans.

Objectives
Explain the concept and design of virtual memory.
Describe the benefits of virtual memory to operating systems.
Understand the history and initial design of virtual memory.
Explore the progress, current trends, and future plans for virtual memory.
Concept
Virtual Memory is a storage allocation scheme that provides an illusion of a larger main memory by addressing secondary memory (e.g., hard disk). It maps program addresses to physical addresses in memory, enabling efficient data handling and performance enhancement.

Techniques in Virtual Memory
Paging: Divides memory into equal-sized pages, allowing non-contiguous allocation.
Segmentation: Divides memory into variable-sized segments, each representing logical units like functions or procedures.
Design History
Early Virtual Machines
M44/44X (1964): IBM's project introduced early virtual memory.
Cambridge Monitor System (1960s): Introduced virtual machines on modified System/360.
VM/370 (1970s): Featured virtual memory on IBM System/370.
Modern Virtual Machines
VMware (1999): Enabled guest OS to run unmodified.
Denali (2002): Introduced paravirtualization.
Hyper-V (2008): Utilized x86 hardware virtualization extensions.
Original Design
Early virtual machines evolved from multiprogramming, involving context-switching and multiprocessing, laying the foundation for modern virtual memory systems.

Progress in Development
Virtual memory has advanced significantly, with developments such as:

1960s-70s: Transition to paging-based systems.
1980s: Introduction of hardware support for virtual memory.
Present: Enhanced efficiency and scalability for modern applications.
Current Trends
Machine Learning: Enhances memory management through predictive algorithms.
Non-Volatile Memory (NVM): Improves performance and energy efficiency.
Hybrid Cloud: Integrates private and public cloud services for efficient data handling.
Importance to Operating Systems
Virtual memory enhances OS performance, stability, and efficiency by:

Providing protection and security.
Ensuring process isolation.
Enabling efficient resource management.
Challenges
Page Faults: Delays due to memory page retrieval from slower storage.
Complexity: Overheads in system design and maintenance.
Security: Vulnerabilities in virtual memory systems.
Future Design Plans
Future virtual memory systems will involve advanced algorithms, optimized memory operations for mobile devices, and efficient data sharing in cloud computing.

Program Concept
The Pediatric Surgery Management System simulates virtual memory management using a medical analogy. Main memory represents pediatric surgery, disk represents the pediatric department, and beds represent memory frames. The program prioritizes patient transfers based on their health status, simulating memory allocation and management.

Practical Part
Initialization
Create instances of PediatricSurgery and Pediatric.
Read patient data from files to populate initial state.
Transfer Actions
Simulate patient transfers based on health status.
Update and display resulting states after each transfer round.
User Interaction
Change patient status.
Add new patients.
Remove patients.
Exit the program.
Flowchart and Class Diagram
Provide visual representations of the program's flow and structure.
